# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis

<strong class="mb-30"><b>Problem statement</b></strong>
                      <p class="mb-30">Online hotel reservations are a popular method for booking hotel rooms. Travellers can book rooms on a computer by using online security to protect their privacy and financial information and by using several online travel agents to compare prices and facilities at different hotels.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Prior to the Internet, travellers could write, telephone the hotel directly, or use a travel agent to make a reservation. Nowadays, online travel agents have pictures of hotels and rooms, information on prices and deals, and even information on local resorts. Many also allow reviews of the traveler to be recorded with the online travel agent.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Online hotel reservations are also helpful for making last minute travel arrangements. Hotels may drop the price of a room if some rooms are still available. There are several websites that specialize in searches for deals on rooms.</p>
                      <strong class="mb-30"><b>Hypothesis</b></strong>
                      <p class="mb-30">1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.</p>
                      <strong class="mb-30"><b>Suggestions</b></strong>
                      <p class="mb-30">1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 2. As the ratio of cancellations and not cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"> 4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.</p>
